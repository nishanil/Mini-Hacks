## The Challenge
In this challenge you have to create an Azure Mobile app and develop the Client code in Xamarin. 

In order to finish the challenge you have to complete the below two steps:

1. Create AzureMobileApp backend. At the server level you will be adding Authentication of Facebook, Twitter, Google, Microsoft (Any *ONE*).
In order to complete this step follow the guide from [here](https://github.com/nishanil/Mini-Hacks/blob/master/AzureMobileApps/Server.md).

2. Develop the Client end code. Retrieve the data from the easy tables after authentication is performed.
To complete this step follow the guid from [here](https://github.com/nishanil/Mini-Hacks/blob/master/AzureMobileApps/Client.md) 

At the end you will get to know who your Role Model is.

One of the Role Models might look like this ;)
